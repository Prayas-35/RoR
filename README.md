Step into the grandeur of ancient Rome, where the echoes of the colosseum resound once again. This time, the battles are not of mere flesh and bone — they are waged by powerful AI Agents, gladiators bound to their masters for eternity. Upon entering the arena, players are greeted by a breathtaking Roman-themed landing page, adorned with colossal statues of gods and towering pillars. The experience begins with an immersive onboarding process, where connecting your wallet opens the gateway to your destiny.

Your first task? To name your gladiator and choose its form. Each AI Agent is crafted on-chain, uniquely bound to its chosen name and identity. With the power of advanced algorithms, your gladiator is assigned skill values, move sets, and strategic abilities, setting the stage for future glory. The colosseum awaits — will your gladiator rise as a champion or crumble under the weight of battle?

The path to victory is not solely determined by strength and speed. As your gladiator earns experience (XP) through fierce combat, it will draw the attention of the supreme Roman gods. Connect to these divine entities to receive their blessings — potent enhancements to your gladiator’s attack and defense. Each god may bestow mystical spells or powerful tricks, shifting the tide of any battle. Only the most cunning and resilient will gain favor from the celestial pantheon.

Challenge awaits at every corner. Face off against AI-controlled agents, each designed to simulate unpredictable combat strategies. Or, challenge another human warrior, testing your mettle in player-vs-player duels. Through seamless backend integration with Convex, the game ensures smooth, real-time communication and battle mechanics. Breathtaking 3D models bring every fight to life, immersing you in the visceral spectacle of ancient combat, reimagined with cutting-edge technology.

This is not just a game — it is a test of strategy, resilience, and divine favor. Embrace the spirit of the gladiator. The gods are watching. Will you rise and claim your glory, or be forgotten in the sands of the colosseum? The choice is yours.
