# CryptoPoly

This project is a Web3 adaptation of a classic board game inspired by Monopoly. Players enter the game by paying a crypto entry fee, which funds a communal pool. Upon joining, each player is issued a starting balance in a native ERC-20 token. Instead of using NFTs for properties, properties are handled as in-game objects, eliminating the need for players to approve multiple wallet transactions. At the end of the game, when one player remains, 90% of the pooled funds is awarded to the winner, and 10% goes to the platform as a fee. This minimalistic approach focuses on core functionalities—token issuance, pool funding, and winner payout—while ensuring a smooth and engaging player experience.

## Development Process Outline
Frontend Development (Next.js + TypeScript):

### Landing Page:
Wallet connection interface
Entry fee payment integration
Game Page:
Real-time game board displaying player positions and property objects
Minimalistic, intuitive design for ease of play
Additional Pages:
Pool/Stats Page (optional): Overview of game status and fund pool
Swap/Exchange Page (if needed): For token interactions or future features
Smart Contract Development (Hardhat + Solidity):

### Token.sol:
Implement ERC-20 standard token functions (mint, transfer, burn)
GameManager.sol:
Handle player registration, property assignment, and in-game transactions
Track game progress and determine the winner
PoolManager.sol:
Manage collection of entry fees
Distribute winnings (90% to the winner, 10% to the platform)
Testing & Security:
Write comprehensive tests using Hardhat
Engage in smart contract audits to ensure security and efficiency

### Integration with Wallets (Wagmi):
Implement smooth wallet integration for hassle-free transactions
Optimize for minimal user interaction during gameplay
Deployment & Monitoring:

Deploy contracts on a testnet for initial testing and user feedback
Monitor gas costs and optimize transaction flow
Gradually roll out to mainnet after thorough testing and audits

### Future Enhancements:
Incorporate optional AI agents for automated gameplay
Integrate Layer-2 solutions for scalability and lower transaction fees
Expand game features based on community feedback and analytics
